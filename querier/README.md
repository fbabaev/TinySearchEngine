# Querier

## Introduction
The Querier is a key component of the Tiny Search Engine (TSE) that interfaces directly with the user, processing and executing search queries against an indexed dataset. This README provides an overview of the Querier’s functionality, compilation instructions, and usage examples.

## Functionality
The Querier processes user-input queries to search through an index generated by the TSE Indexer. It supports complex queries that include logical operators `AND` and `OR` to refine search results. The Querier ranks the documents based on the relevance to the search terms and displays the results in a sorted order.

## Compilation
To compile the Querier, navigate to the querier directory and run the following command:
```
make
```
This will compile the Querier and any necessary dependencies.

## Usage
To use the Querier, you must specify the page directory and the index file created by the TSE Crawler and Indexer, respectively. Here is the syntax for running the Querier:
```
./querier pageDirectory indexFilename
```
- `pageDirectory`: The directory containing files produced by the Crawler.
- `indexFilename`: The file containing the inverted index produced by the Indexer.

### Example Command
```
./querier ../data/pages ../data/index.dat
```

## Query Syntax
The Querier supports a simple query syntax that allows combinations of words with logical operators `AND` and `OR`. Here are some rules for writing queries:
- Queries can include one or more words separated by spaces.
- Use `AND` to find documents containing all the words.
- Use `OR` to find documents containing any of the words.
- The operators must be in uppercase.
- Words are normalized to lowercase before processing.

### Valid Query Examples
- `Dartmouth AND college`
- `computer OR science`
- `the AND history of OR Dartmouth`

### Invalid Query Examples
- `AND Dartmouth college` (Cannot start with an operator)
- `Dartmouth OR` (Cannot end with an operator)
- `college AND OR science` (Cannot have consecutive operators)

## Output
Results are displayed as a list of document IDs, each associated with a score that indicates the relevance of the document to the query. The results are sorted in descending order of relevance.

## Cleaning Up
To clean up the compilation artifacts, run:
```
make clean
```
